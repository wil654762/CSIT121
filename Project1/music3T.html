    <h2>I Love Music!</h2>
      <p>My favorite genres are Rap, Pop, Jazz, R&B, and EDM. It's often pretty hard to find me outside of the house without a pair of headphones handy. I even have a backup pair in case my first pair gets lost. I also find music to be essential for my studyig process. Without it, I would find it very difficult to focus on my work. </p>
