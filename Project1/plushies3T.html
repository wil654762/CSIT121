    <h2>I Love Plushies!</h2>
      <p>Stuffed animals have a special place in my heart. They are soft, cute, and can be a great addition to any surface. I believe a well placed plush can be a great way to brighten up any room as they come in so many different shapes, sizes, and themes. I hope to expand my small collection one day but for now, I love window shopping for them and admiring the creativity toy designers have to offer today. </p>
