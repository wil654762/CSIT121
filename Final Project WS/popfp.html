      <p>A genre-defying artist, Willow reinvents pop, R&B, and rock in her own individualistic ways. As a singer/songwriter, she debuted with the viral 2010 hit "Whip My Hair," becoming the youngest artist to date to score a double-platinum single. On her 2015 self-produced full-length debut, Ardipithecus, she added alt-R&B textures to her style. By the time of 2017's The 1st, her sound had evolved to include pastoral acoustic elements, while 2019's self-titled album brought touches of dream pop into her music. In 2021, the pop chameleon added punk rock to her repertoire with Lately I Feel Everything and continued her maturation with 2022's COPINGMECHANISM. Along the way, she was a frequent collaborator with brother Jaden, as well as Tyler Cole (as the duo the Anxiety) and Jahnavi Harrison (for 2020's R I S E). In addition to film and music, she is also a fashion icon, social rights advocate, and television personality, starring alongside her mother and grandmother on the family talk show Red Table Talk.
