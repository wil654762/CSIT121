      <p>Sampha's artful and emotive mix of R&B, pop, and electronic music isn't easily categorizable, and is further distinguished by a heartfelt vocal style that tends to sound as if it's on the brink of choking back tears. The artist established himself as a valued remixer and studio collaborator sought by emergent underground talents and mainstream stars alike, including SBTRKT, Jessie Ware, Drake, Beyonc√©, and Kanye West. Process, his 2017 full-length debut, went Top Ten in his native U.K. and won the Mercury Prize. Following its release, Sampha humbly continued to assist a similarly vast range of artists, including Florence + the Machine, Alicia Keys, Actress, and Kendrick Lamar, most remarkably contributing to the latter's Grammy-winning Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. Lahai, the brighter and broader follow-up to Process, landed in 2023 with Sampha's introspective lyrics coalescing with inspirations such as his grandfather, fatherhood, time travel, and Afrofuturism.
